Thirukkural by Tiruvalluvar (a Tamil poet/writer) was written more than 5,000 yrs ago. It is one of the ancient science on Human Behaviour, which has not changed in spite of modern education & technology!

SOME GOLDEN THOUGHTS OF THIRUKKURAL:

- If your child lies to you often, it is because you over-react too harshly to their inappropriate behaviour.

- If your child is not taught to confide in you about their mistakes, you’ve lost them.

- If your child had poor self-esteem, it is because you advise them more than you encourage them.

- If your child does not stand up for themselves, it is because from a young age you have disciplined them regularly in public.

- If your child takes things that do not belong to them, it is because when you buy them things, you don’t let them chose what they want.

- If your child is cowardly, it is because you help them too quickly.

- If your child does not respect other people’s feelings, it is because instead of speaking to your child, you order & command them.

- If your child is too quick to anger, it is because you give too much attention to misbehaviour & you give little attention to good behaviour.

- If your child is excessively jealous, it is because you only congratulate them when they successfully complete something & not when they improve at something even if they don’t successfully complete it

- If your child intentionally disturbs you, it is because you are not physically affectionate enough.

- If your child is openly defiant, it is because you openly threaten to do something but don’t follow through.

- If your child is secretive, it is because they don’t trust that you won’t blow things out of proportion.

- If your child talks back to you, it is because they watch you do it to others & think its normal behaviour.

- If your child doesn’t listen to you but listens to others, it is because you are too quick to jump to conclusions

- If your child rebels it is because they know you care more about what others think than what is right

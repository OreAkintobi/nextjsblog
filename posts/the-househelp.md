You never miss it every day. You go outside in the morning to wash the car, or unlock the gate, or accept a visitor, and she’s right there doing laundry. Waiting for you to direct your gaze in her direction so that she can flash her brown teeth and give you that playful gaze she saves for the people she likes seeing. You know the kind of gaze it is. You got that look from your mother when you were much younger. Your first girlfriend. Your French teacher. And the girl who you knew was crushing on you, but you didn't really give a shit about. And now here it is again. From another person you more or less don’t really bother with. But as she washes another basket of laundry, wearing the same sports bra she wears on Mondays and Wednesdays or any other time, you shrug and smile back. It’s probably harmless. It’s not like you want to fuck her.

It’s not like she’s horrible or anything. She just doesn't do it for you. She could smile a smile the width of your bedpost, but the truth is that she would walk right by you at the mall or in the market, and you wouldn't give her a second look. She would be a 5 on your 1-10 scale of hotness. And don’t act like you don’t rate her at all. You rate all women who are sane and not your mother and sister. Sometimes, you even rate females that are a lot closer to home. Not that you’d care to admit it. I wouldn't admit to killing or cheating or stealing. If I’m not caught, why discuss it? That’s another story. Back to the help.

You do not think about her often at all. But when you do think of her, pretty is not the first word that comes to mind. At first, you only wonder what goes through her little head whenever you catch her looking at you. And you can only wonder what exactly she wishes to say to you, since her English is at the same level as that of your 2-year-old nephew. So when you see her, all you do is stop, smile and move along. No harm, no foul. It’s not like you want to fuck her, anyway.

Afterwards, a single event takes place in your narrative. This could probably be the first time that it rained and you couldn't get home in time to get your clothes off the line. Well, not to worry. Your neighbor's house help has packed up all of your clothes from the line (your sister’s or mother’s clothes are irrelevant to her, of course), folded them into neat squares, and is knocking on your burglary proof to deliver them, flashing her whites like a torchlight phone on silent. Her whites are actually off-whites. And you notice a little more gut than you would like sticking out from under her regular top. But it’s all okay. You grab your clothes and flash a smile back. It’s all harmless. Not like anything is going to happen.

Needless to say. This kind of repeats itself. And each time she comes to drop your clothes that you forgot on the line during rainy season, you see her more and more often in front of you. And all those things that you didn't like slowly begin to appear insignificant to you. The fact that she has on the same clothes 4 times a week bothers you less and less.  Her little ‘baby bump’ begins to mean less and less to you, until it disappears completely before your eyes. Her body begins to even out, slowly but surely.

It is like puberty on steroids. The more you see her, the better she looks.

Then one day, you’re on your way out of the house. You want to open the gate, but there she is, opening those gates wide for you. You could have sworn you saw her wink. No, that’s probably just how her eyes are. As you move in….. I mean out… you begin to realize that your whole perception of the neighbor’s house help has been changed over the course of a few short weeks. Her small upper frame now serves only to accentuate the presence of an ass you never really noticed before. Her stomach is still there, but you're okay with it, because the boob-to-gut ratio is fairly standard. Her smile registers clearer and clearer in your head. And, like the story of Beauty and the Beast, there are small voices in and around your brain (or what you think is your brain), telling you that there may be something there that wasn't there before.

However, unlike Beauty and the Beast, the something there is not love. It's something else. Something that society urges you to repress and redirect. Something a little less human. Surely, you don't want to.......

Ah.

_awkward silence_

My people say that in the absence of the crocodile, a lizard becomes manageable.

This is when you know you are in trouble.

#### **Guy 1**

I have resigned from my job of 5 months. I have no money, no bright corridor full of potential doors to open, and no new tricks up my sleeve. My savings account these last few months has not been a savings account. At the rate I’ve been withdrawing, I might as well put my money under a mat. The little short-term job I lined up to hold body and soul together just disappeared. The lady doesn’t want to hire me because I was a dick to another HR lady (I don’t know when I got this way. I used to be a snowflake).

I just got dumped by someone who was never my girlfriend. She call me a dick. After that, she laughed off my attempts to wring some reason or sense out of her. All before blocking me on all forms of media and deleting my number. As I type this, she is sleeping with texting my cousin from her desk at work and setting up a hangout to ‘get some closure’.

My parents are loving and supportive now, but within a few weeks to a month and a half, they will get impatient and start asking questions. And they should. After all, I am in my mid-20s and broke. I depend on them for feeding and shelter, drive around in a car they bought and wear clothes that they bought. They say that my previous salary (hereafter referred to as ‘wage’) is trifle ‘compared to what your mates are earning’.

My life is shit.

I have a job which pays pretty decent for someone my age. It doesn’t get me going, but it pays enough for now while I figure stuff out. I don’t like to take risks where I don’t have to. I’d rather take money from my boss while he makes me kiss his ass daily, and my soul dies a little as I go there daily. As much as he believes those are not his intentions, he berates me in front of coworkers and junior staff. He also likes to take the coworker that I see as my future wife for special ‘strategy sessions’ in his office after close of business. She complains to me about how she can’t figure him out, and scoffs when I tell her how I like her too much to treat her so bad.

I live alone in a self-contain. The landlord only smiles with me after I pay my rent. I have no free time to do anything besides work myself to the bone and sleep in my small bed. I have no freedom or sense of self between the hours of 8 am – 5 pm. Even at 7 pm sometimes, I am still slaving away at my desk, fixing mistakes made during the day by me or the other incompetent people around me.

My coworkers have little tolerance for me and only cozy up to me when they need a favor. My line manager micro-manages me every minute instead of just firing me. Even though he believes I am incompetent, I will do what I can for what I am paid. I say ‘Yes, sir’ to him all day, and complain about him all night to whoever will listen. I am well aware that I am unhappy. I can’t quit because I need the money.

Tonight, I was able to get off early, and went to the bar to meet a good friend. He is a great listener, and it is always nice to catch up with people who knew you when times were easier. He listens to me grumble about my job, and just shakes his head. I look at him and comment on how fresh and well-rested he looks. I tell him I wish I had the strength of character to just go with the flow the way he does and not take things too serious the way I am prone to do. I tell him how happy I would be if I could just get a few extra hours of sleep and a bigger savings account due to not needing to pay rent. He was always better with the ladies than I was, so I change the topic and ask him how far with the womenz.

Then he begins to tell me a story about some bitch who might be sleeping with his cousin……

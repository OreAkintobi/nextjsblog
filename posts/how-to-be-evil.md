Lord Macbeth was a general in the army of Duncan, King of Scotland. As he returns home with his comrade from victorious battle, he is accosted by 3 witches in a barren land. They proclaim that he will become the King of Scotland. They also tell him that although he will become King, his children will never ascend the throne after him, but his comrade’s descendants will. After this, they disappear.

Unsure of what to make of this, he tells his wife. She urges him to kill King Duncan, who is a guest at their home. He dispatches of his king/employer fairly easily and becomes king after that, and arranges the murder of his comrade, as well as his comrade’s son. The comrade is killed, but his comrade’s son survives.

When he begins to see ghosts, he seeks the counsel of the witches. They tell him the following:

- Beware of Macduff
- No one born of woman can harm thee
- Do not worry, until Birnam Wood (a well-known forest) moves to Dunsinane.

He fails to murder Macduff, and instead settles for murdering his wife and children. And when Macduff comes knocking on Dunsinane with an army and a temper, Macbeth still believes he is safe, because no one born of a woman can harm me.

Long story short, Macduff kills Macbeth the Usurper and crowns the son of the king murdered by Macbeth.

This is the part where I tell you how to be the right kind of evil.

#### **Assume Nothing**

When Macbeth visits the witches after seeing the ghost of his comrade, and they tell him the guff about Macduff, birth scares, and mobile forests, he can barely hide his delight.

Neat! Now all I have to do is murder this Macduff ogbeni and watch out for any pregnant men. These witches are trippin’ tho. How can a forest move to a castle?

Here’s the thing. After Macduff survives and marches to Dunsinane to fight Macbeth, he stops at Birnam Wood and asks his men to cut down the branches and bring it with them. This was a tactic used in old times by armies to disguise the quantity of their infantry.

**_Birnam Wood moved to Dunsinane._**

Even as Macbeth is informed of what is happening, he dismisses everything, claiming that no man born of a woman could harm him. Then he comes face to face with Macduff, who tells him that he was not born of a woman, but that he was taken out of his mother’s womb.

_MEME_

Macbeth loses the colour in his face, and refuses to fight Macduff. Shortly after, he is killed.

Death by C-Section.

#### **Your Life Choices Are Yours Alone**

Macbeth’s wife is happy to find out that her husband will be king, but she is impatient, she pressures him into murdering Duncan by telling him how much of a coward he must be. She tells him to be more like her; she is ruthless, and would follow through on any and all actions she has promised to undertake, even if she promises to kill her own baby.

I want to question the sense in Macbeth following through on the instructions of a woman who harbored no sense of maternal instinct towards HER OWN CHILD, but I won’t.

At the hour of Macbeth’s death, his leading lady is nowhere to be found. Lady Macbeth sees more ghosts than her husband, runs mad and dies shortly after. Even the Lords Macbeth appoints after his coronation do not go to battle with him.

When Macbeth dies, he dies alone.

We are born and shall die by ourselves. It is only through our love and friendships we create the illusion for the time being that we’re not alone. Remember this, and own your decisions.

#### **Complacency will Kill You. But you must die one day.**

The lives of most evil men (and the great ones as well) are filled with high risk and high reward. Many of them eventually fall by their own hand or by the hand of others that they allow to be close to them; and usually, they never live long enough to see the end of the large wealth and riches they amass for themselves.

But you can be a different kind of person.

All you have to do is NEVER DROP THE FUCKING BALL.

The skin of man has made him fundamentally weak, but many men have learnt to delay gratification and push past their expiry in search of a higher level of satisfaction. This is why Nadal can beat Federer, or Miami can win another championship.

Macbeth doesn’t have this information. Or he does, and doesn’t know what to do with it. When the witches make proclamations about moving forests and a lack of pregnant problems, Macbeth interpretes these proclamations the way he likes. He sees his new life through rose-tinted glasses, and refuses to properly analyze his actions and his threats. He takes on a risky endeavor without seeing it to its bloody conclusion.

If your ambition is not coupled with a relentless ability to see a project through to completion, your ambition is at best foolish, and at worst fatal. You will die without enjoying the fruit of your labor, and your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely light.

As soon as you find out what you want, write it down.

Never forget why you do what you do.
